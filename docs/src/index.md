## Features
### 180x180x180mm Build Volume
Whilst many printers feature an ever-increasing build volume, the most common FDM prints are small. A smaller build volume means less moving mass, leading to faster and better looking prints.

### 3060 Extrusion Frame
Utilizing 3060 extrusion for its frame, the V-Minion is extremely sturdy. This allows for faster printing with lower vibration, all leading to better looking prints.

### Linear Rail based Motion System
The V-Minion features linear rails on all 3 axes, providing smooth and quiet motion.

### Precision Milled Bed
The V-Minion features a custom made, precision milled, 5mm bed plate designed for exceptional flatness and heat stability. Going one step further, we have worked directly with Keenovo, industry leaders in silicone heaters, to develop a bed heater which is both high performance, and safe due to its built-in thermal protection.

### Enclosed Electronics Case
All of the V-Minion electronics fit into the specially designed case. It has been designed to house the power supply, a Raspberry Pi, as well as your printer mainboard, all whilst providing cooling via a built-in 40mm fan. The default design supports the BTT SKR2, BTT SKR Mini and the BTT Octopus mainboards. The side panels are CNC manufactured from 4mm Polycarbonate, making them incredibly strong, but can also be printed if you prefer.

### Spool Holder
The on-frame spool holder is designed to complement the V-Minion. Based upon the same 30 series extrusion as the rest of the printer, it keeps your filament close-by and makes moving the printer a breeze because the filament comes with you.

### RatOS
RatOS is developed in-house especially for our printers. It combines the power of the Klipper firmware, as well as several other open-source projects, to provide a stable and easy-to-use operating system for all your printing needs.

## Support
### Build Guide
The V-Minion has a comprehensive step-by-step build guide in both static and animated forms. Each section is broken down into easy to follow steps, detailing the parts needed and how to assemble them. A fully animated build video is also provided, should you wish to see exactly how each part is designed to fit together.

## Acknowledgments

The V-Minion is an open-source project which is a result of countless hours of collaboration between our design team, the 3D printing community, and our beta team, all of whom share their knowledge freely to help push the 3D printing space forward as a whole. Being developed by using such a vast array of knowledge means that it is difficult to trace back any one idea, thus making attributions difficult at best. Regardless, we would like to acknowledge the following people and projects for their contribution to the V-Minion. They are as follows (in no particular order):

- Paweł Kucmus
- João Barros
- Eduardo Oliveira
- Tomasz Paluszkiewicz
- Mikkel Schmidt
- Detlev Meinhard Friedrich Rackow
- Lukas Sinitsch
