Order Now! Features \u00b6 180x180x180mm Build Volume \u00b6 Whilst many printers feature an ever-increasing build volume, the most common FDM prints are small. A smaller build volume means less moving mass, leading to faster and better looking prints. 3060 Extrusion Frame \u00b6 Utilizing 3060 extrusion for its frame, the V-Minion is extremely sturdy. This allows for faster printing with lower vibration, all leading to better looking prints. Linear Rail based Motion System \u00b6 The V-Minion features linear rails on all 3 axes, providing smooth and quiet motion. EVA Modular Print Head System \u00b6 The V-Minion features EVA for its extruder and hotend carriage platform. This means you can use a wide range of extruder and hotend combinations, outside of the ones we supply. There are many options. EVA allows your printer to be open to updates in hotend or extruder technology in the future: every year there are new hotends and extruders which are released by so many amazing manufacturers. How cool is it that you get to simply re-print your print head and upgrate to a new hotend or extruder? EVA is a project developped by Pawe\u0142 Kucmus, read more about EVA in the official EVA project page . Precision Milled Bed \u00b6 The V-Minion features a custom made, precision milled, 5mm bed plate designed for exceptional flatness and heat stability. Going one step further, we have worked directly with Keenovo, industry leaders in silicone heaters, to develop a bed heater which is both high performance, and safe due to its built-in thermal protection. Enclosed Electronics Case \u00b6 All of the V-Minion electronics fit into the specially designed case. It has been designed to house the power supply, a Raspberry Pi, as well as your printer mainboard, all whilst providing cooling via a built-in 40mm fan. The default design supports the BTT SKRat, BTT SKR2, BTT SKR Mini and the BTT Octopus mainboards. The side panels are CNC manufactured from 4mm Polycarbonate, making them incredibly strong, but can also be printed if you prefer. Spool Holder \u00b6 The on-frame spool holder is designed to complement the V-Minion. Based upon the same 30 series extrusion as the rest of the printer, it keeps your filament close-by and makes moving the printer a breeze because the filament comes with you. RatOS \u00b6 RatOS is developed in-house especially for our printers. It combines the power of the Klipper firmware, as well as several other open-source projects, to provide a stable and easy-to-use operating system for all your printing needs. Dimensions \u00b6 Support \u00b6 Build Guide \u00b6 The V-Minion has a comprehensive step-by-step build guide in both static and animated forms. Each section is broken down into easy to follow steps, detailing the parts needed and how to assemble them. A fully animated build video is also provided, should you wish to see exactly how each part is designed to fit together. Rat Rig Community \u00b6 Rat Rig maintains an active user community on Facebook where you can connect with other users of Rat Rig products. Come join us to share builds, knowledge, mods, and stay up to date on all current and future products. Rat Rig 3D Printer Community Sample Prints / Parts \u00b6 These images showcase 3D prints produced by V-Minion machines belonging to members of our community. Clicking any image will open the full size version. Acknowledgments \u00b6 The V-Minion is an open-source project which is a result of countless hours of collaboration between our design team, the 3D printing community, and our beta team, all of whom share their knowledge freely to help push the 3D printing space forward as a whole. Being developed by using such a vast array of knowledge means that it is difficult to trace back any one idea, thus making attributions difficult at best. Regardless, we would like to acknowledge the following people and projects for their contribution to the V-Minion. They are as follows (in no particular order): Pawe\u0142 Kucmus Jo\u00e3o Barros Eduardo Oliveira Tomasz Paluszkiewicz Mikkel Schmidt Antonios Antzoulatos Detlev Meinhard Friedrich Rackow Lukas Sinitsch M\u00e1rcio Pereira Dennis Jespersen Marc Marschall David Menzel Thomas Ret Mihai Stanimir Harald Wagener License \u00b6 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International You may share, remix and mod the design.

This is also a great resource to seek support, ask opinions to other users, and share ideas. The community is about much more than product support, though. This is where Rat Rig developers get to interact with their users, hear from them, understand their wants and needs, and define future product strategy in response to their feedback. It\u2019s also the place where more advanced users share mods they\u2019ve made to their machines to better suit their needs and preferences - and this is often a great source of inspiration, both to other users and to the Rat Rig team itself. Rat Rig 3D Printers are not the brainchild of Rat Rig in isolation. Instead, they are the result of a continuous and tight-knit feedback loop between users and developers. Join us and take part of this beautiful process that has been building on top of itself for many years and throughout many product iterations! Beta/Dev Team \u00b6 If you\u2019re passionate and knowledgeable about 3D Printing, you may be interested to learn that our Beta/Development Team is mostly made of users who at some point in time bought one of our printers and got involved in the community. Active and knowledgeable members who passionately contribute to the community don\u2019t go by unnoticed, and will sometimes be invited to join the team. If this is something that gets you excited, come and join us, connecting is always the first step on the Rat Rig journey! Beta/Dev users not only get to influence product strategy and design decisions, but also benefit from several awesome perks, like early access to products and discounted prices on all orders. Above everything else, they get to participate in extremely nerdy debates with like-minded people, and witness how those debates materialize over time in products who will be enjoyed by many people.

Make sure you keep checking official sources too, to ensure you always have access to the most accurate/updated information. Even though this is an unofficial community, over time we\u2019ve found that this is one of the best resources for users seeking technical support. There are many knowledgeable and super helpful members on the server, and their response time is usually much shorter than what Rat Rig can provide as a company.
